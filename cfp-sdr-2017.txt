             Call for Papers: Salon des Refusés 2017

                   (a workshop on programming)

              Co-located with <Programming> 2017

============================================================================

Salon des Refusés ("exhibition of rejects") was an 1863 exhibition of artworks
rejected from the official Paris Salon. The jury of Paris Salon required near-
photographic realism and classified works according to a strict genre
hierarchy. Paintings by many, later famous, modernists such as Édouard Manet
were rejected and appeared in what became known as the Salon des Refusés. This
workshop aims to be the programming language research equivalent of Salon des
Refusés. We provide a venue for exploring new ideas and new ways of doing
computer science.

Many interesting ideas about programming might struggle to find space in the
modern programming language research community, often because they are
difficult to evaluate using established evaluation methods (be it proofs,
measurements or controlled user studies). As a result, new ideas are often seen
as "unscientific".

This workshop provides a venue where such interesting and thought-provoking
ideas can be exposed to critical evaluation. Submissions that provoke
interesting discussion among the program committee members will be published
together with an attributed review that presents an alternative position,
develops additional context or summarizes discussion from the workshop. This
means of engaging with papers not just enables explorations of novel
programming ideas, but also encourages new ways of doing computer science.


### Submission guidance

The scope of the workshop is determined more by the format of submissions than
by the specific area of programming language or computer science research that
we are interested in. We welcome submissions in a format that makes it possible
to think about programming in a new way, including, but not limited to:

* Thought experiments -- we believe that thought experiments, analogies and
  illustrative metaphors can provide novel insights and inspire fruitful
  programming language ideas.
* Experimentation -- we find prejudices in favour of theory, as far back as
  there is institutionalized science, but programming can often be seen more as
  experimentation than as theorizing. We welcome interesting experiments even
  if there is yet no overarching theory that explains why they happened.
* Paradigms -- all scientific work is rooted in a scientific paradigm that
  frame what questions can be asked. We encourage submissions that reflect on
  existing paradigms or explore alternative scientific paradigms.
* Metaphors, myths and analogies -- any description of formal, mathematical,
  quantitative or even poetical nature still represents just an analogy. We
  believe that fruitful ideas can be learned from less common forms of
  analogies as well as from the predominant, formal and mathematical ones.
* From jokes to science fiction -- a story or an artistic performance may
  explore ideas and spark conversations that provide crucial inspiration for
  development of new computer science thinking.


### Submission format and review process

We welcome short papers (up to 3000 words) and long papers (up to 9000
words) as well as screencasts or interactive essays. We intend to publish
accepted papers on the web, but any format is welcome for submission
(authors can use the <Programming> paper template). There are no specific
criteria of interest, except that a good submission will be one that sparks
interesting discussions among the workshop attendees and benefits from the
critical review process.

The PC members have briefly summarised their interests on the workshop web
page <http://2017.programming-conference.org/track/refuses-2017> -- this may
provide some inspiration for your submission, but is by no means a complete
list of topics!

* Deadline for submissions: February 10th 2017
* Notification of authors: February 27th 2017
* Early registration deadline: March 6th 2017
* Workshop at <Programming> 2017: April 4th
