# Programming is Writing is Programming

Felienne Hermans


## Analogies

We can say forall X. Programming is X is Programming, but this
just tells us more about the author and situation than about programming
For example, Programming is Cooking (Grace Hopper).

The interesting question is why do we want to make the analogy?
(i.e. what do we want to achieve by using one as a model)
There are two reasons for programming is writing alluded to in the paper
First, we can talk about process and see if writing process tells us 
something about programming process. Second, a lot of programming is
understanding code and that's something that PLT does not talk about, 
so looking at how people understand text might be fun.

## Meaning

### Styling 

In programming, alpha conversion means that 

    let person = lookupEntity(name)
    print(person.Name)
    
equals by alpha conversion to
    
    let x = lookupEntity(name)
    print(x.Name)
         
Writing teaches us that this is obviously false.

### The essence 

Waiting for Godot - this says what the book is about, but that's not why we read the book.
Style matters. Maybe not for running code, but for people.

### Formatting
 
 - what if we could make formatting a part of program meaning?

### Revolution
 
 - write programs for reading, not exection! Algol publication language
 - or can we make formatting and styling part of meaning?
   Can my alpha transformation above break code?

## Rules

### Against good writing rules

 - pirsig on rules for "good writing"
 
### Against good programming rules

??

### tldr
 
 - descriptive vs. prescriptive

## Summary

Yes, programming is writing is a useful analogy, because
Semantics of program is more like semantics of text (i.e. formatting and style should matter)
Rules are equally bad!

## Pirsig on rules for "good writing"

> [T]he rule was pasted on to the writing after the writing was all done. <br />
> It was post hoc, after the fact, instead of prior to the fact. 
>
> And he became convinced that all the writers the students were supposed to 
> mimic wrote without rules, putting down whatever sounded right, then 
> going back to see if it still sounded right and changing it if it didn't.

- Explore how coding style can _carry meaning_
- What _rules_ might be worth _breaking_?
- Not joking! _Pseudocode_ is the same since 1960s

## The essence of program or text

For text, we know _plot is not the essence_ of text.

<div class="fragment">

For programs, we believe there is a succinct <br />
essence or high-level program description.
