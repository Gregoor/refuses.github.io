title: Dialectics for new computer science

abstract1: |
  <p>Salon des Refusés (“exhibition of rejects”) was an 1863 exhibition of artworks rejected from
  the official Paris Salon. It displayed works by later famous modernists such as Édouard Manet,
  whose paintings were rejected by the conservative jury of the Paris Salon. We feel that a similar space 
  is needed to explore new ideas and new ways of doing programming research and computer science.</p>

  <p>Many interesting ideas about programming struggle to find space in the modern programming 
  language research community, often because they are difficult to evaluate using proofs, 
  measurements or controlled user studies. As a result, new ideas are often seen as “unscientific”.</p>
  
abstract2: |
  <p>To provide space for unorthodox thought provoking ideas, we take inspiration from literary
  criticism. Papers that provoked an interesting discussion or criticism among the program committee 
  members were presented together with an attributed critical review that presents an alternative
  position, develops additional context or summarizes discussion about the work.</p>

  <p>In 2017, we accepted the 8 most inspiring papers out of 16 submissions. Below, you'll
  find the revised versions of the papers with critical commentary. We hope both will
  encou&shy;rage you to find new ways of doing and thinking about computer science!</p>

## The nature of program code

Should we treat program code as a _text_ just like works of literature or as _blocks_ in 
visual programming languages? The first two papers looks at different ways of thinking and
working with code.

### Programming is Writing is Programming

> Felienne Hermans, Marlies Aldewereld<br />
> Review: Tomas Petricek

#### Paper abstract 
Writing and programming are often seen as different: writing a creative profession, 
programming a technical one. Below the surface however, there is one striking similarity.
This paper compares writing and programming and uncovers similarities between some of the steps 
of writing and programming workflows. We also observe differences, like the attention that 
writers spent on formatting and styling, and the opportunity for feedback in programming.

#### Review abstract
We can draw an analogy between programming and many other activities ranging from engineering
to artistic performance. What unique perspectives can writing offer? First, writing is about
communicating with the reader. Unlike with programs, attempts to reduce writing to a core meaning
often fail. ALso Style in programmin

### Code is not just text: Why our code editors are inadequate tools

> Gregor Weber<br />
> Review: Felienne Hermans

#### Paper abstract
The most popular code editors treat it like any other form of text.
Tis leads to all kinds of problems, from grave syntax errors to the
seemingly superficial code style inconsistencies. Alternative editors,
namely visual programming languages, are available, but mostly
in the form of educational tools and therefor have their own set of
problems when used productively. But there might be a middle ground
worth exploring, between the high productivity of traditional editors
and the constrained interactivity of visual programming languages.
